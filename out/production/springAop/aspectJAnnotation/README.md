2.Create the CustomerBoImpl to implement CustomerBo
3.Create LoggingAspect to intercept the CustomerBo
4.Create the spring bean configure file aspectJAnnotation.xml
5.Add the annotation for LoggingAspect
6.Create the App class to retrieve the customer bean from aspectJAnnotation.xml file and run related method.
